# Review — 025-rule-opt-out

## Summary

Five-pass review of 025 over `37c8219c..1fbc0636` plus the working tree, after task 10's fail-fast fix (`a32af25b`). The 116 scope entries are the 2026-10-19 rule-file window that 034's review read in an earlier session, plus this session's 063 commits, the 025 fix and 019's open question. **What this session read** (`examined: 40`): 025's `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` and scenario in full; `runtime/src/primitives/discover_rule_files.rs` in full (by this pass and two parallel reviewer passes reading `a32af25b` through git); the fix's diffs to `runtime/src/primitives/mod.rs` and `framework/commands/review.md`, with review.md's Inputs, step-5 filter, Waivers and adopter notes; 022's `review-runtime-acceleration` scenario in full; all eleven `framework/rules/*.md` in full; and the files 063's review and analysis read earlier this session (063's six artifacts and records, `check_artifact_size.rs`, the three other command sources, README, the bootstrap, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, 019's scenario, spec and tasks, 039's `review.md`). **Not read** (76 entries): `framework/bootstrap/govern.md` (`cmp` identical), the generated mirrors (`scripts/gen-claude-commands.sh --check` in sync), `framework/commands/status.md` beyond the disabled-rule-files callout AC6 names, `framework/constitution.md` beyond §design-principles and the §rules opt-out paragraph, `docs/`, and the other specs' artifacts. **Findings: none remain.** One MUST fired on the deliverable and was fixed in the run: `BE-INPUT-011`, since the notice lines rendered `file` raw and `reason` through `collapse_whitespace` alone, so a newline in `file` forged a `loading rule files:` line and an escape sequence in `reason` survived; both now pass through `flatten_line`. `BE-COMPAT-001` was judged met (the result schema is unchanged), and the plan now classifies the behavior change as breaking with a minor-bump commitment. **The fix:** a malformed entry halts `discover-rule-files` before selection with `PrimitiveError::InvalidDisabledRuleFile`, naming the index, the field and the value; verified through the CLI binary in a `/tmp` fixture. Seven mutations run this session each fail a test (skip instead of halt, byte counting, no flattening in the error, in the `file` notice and in the `reason` notice, Debug formatting, rejecting adopter fields). **Observations: 35.** Eight fixed in the run (the value named in a type mismatch, non-ASCII reasons shown as written, the halted run's non-zero exit stated, review.md's `<config-path>`, AC1's 15-codepoint example annotated, two rotted AGENTS.md line citations in the Motivation replaced, the config path returned once, an adopter-field test). Two new discards: 025's spent task 2, and `[rules] surfaces` validated only inside the rule-directory branch, which is 033's contract. The 8 routed and 17 discarded observations standing from earlier passes keep their text and dispositions; the routed note on 025's own task 10 is discharged by this fix and is not carried.
