# Review — 037-observability-backend-rules

## Summary

Five-pass review of 037 over `37c8219c..69a7b473` plus the working tree. Its 90 scope entries are the shared window of the 2026-10-19 rule-file campaign that 034's review read this session — less 045's restored `plan.md` — plus 034's and 036's new `review.md` and `analysis.md`. **Method.** The shared entries were read by 034's review (eight parallel reviewer passes, every observation re-verified, the whole fixed diff re-read), and every later change to them is this session's own fix in the 034 and 036 commits, re-read as diffs; this pass read in full `framework/rules/observability-backend.md`, 037's spec, plan and tasks, and the four new records. **Examined: 86 of 90.** The four generated command mirrors (`.claude/commands/ductus/analyze.md`, `.claude/commands/ductus/review.md`, `.pi/prompts/ductus-analyze.md`, `.pi/prompts/ductus-review.md`) were not read; `scripts/gen-claude-commands.sh --check` reports them in sync. **Findings: none** — no loaded rule's trigger fires on rule prose or these spec artifacts. **Observations: 25, none new.** The 10 routed and 15 discarded observations standing from 034's and 036's passes still hold on the unchanged shared files and are recorded with the same dispositions and keys; 037's own defects that 034's pass found (a `BE-LOG-005` citation the file never makes, a required scrape interval no rule names, a Motivation promising SLOs and alerting, and `BE-METRIC-004`'s Statement against its Verification) were fixed there. **037's acceptance criteria:** all seven verified against `observability-backend.md` — the canonical schema and `-backend.md` suffix; `METRIC`, `TRACE` and `HEALTH` declared in the header and disjoint from the other backend files (`scripts/lint-rule-ids.sh` passes over 297 IDs); metrics, tracing and health covered with design-time Verification clauses; the two MUSTs, `BE-TRACE-001` and `BE-HEALTH-001`, are the outage-detection cases and the nine others SHOULD; `BE-LOG-006`, `BE-LOG-008`, `CFG-CONST-*`/`CFG-ENV-*` and `CFG-ENV-006` cited rather than restated; and the manifest row between `configuration-cross.md` and `performance-backend.md`.
