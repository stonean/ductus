# Review — 060-exec-analyze-assesses-each-loaded-rule

## Summary

Five-pass review of 060 over `37c8219c..28e17a5e` plus the working tree. Its 109 scope entries are the shared window of the 2026-10-19 rule-file campaign that 034's review read this session (less 045's restored `plan.md`), the review, analysis and status records this session wrote for 034–039 and 050, and 060's plan Affected Files: the runtime sources, test fixtures, golden and parity test that implement the per-rule exec walk, `framework/commands/analyze.md`, 022's spec and data model, and `version`. None of those plan files changed in the window except a one-line doc comment in `runtime/src/primitives/mod.rs`. **Method.** The shared entries were read by 034's review (eight parallel reviewer passes, every observation re-verified) and changed since only by this session's own fixes, re-read as diffs. This pass read 060's spec and tasks; `framework/commands/analyze.md` in full; `runtime/src/primitives/rule_sections.rs` and `runtime/src/interpreter/analyze_tally.rs` in full; in `runtime/src/interpreter/mod.rs` the walker's rule loading and per-rule `assessSpecQuality` fan-out; in `runtime/src/interpreter/payload.rs` the request builder; in 022's data model the `assessSpecQuality` section; and `version`. **Examined: 99 of 109.** Not read: `runtime/src/schema/primitives.rs`, `runtime/src/primitives/check_rule_ids.rs`, the `analyze-basic` fixture's `configuration.md` and `stdin.jsonl`, `runtime/tests/golden/analyze-basic.jsonl` and `runtime/tests/parity.rs`, all unchanged in the window and exercised by `cargo test --release --locked`, which passed this session (21 result lines, the `analyze-basic` parity golden included); and the four generated command mirrors, which `scripts/gen-claude-commands.sh --check` reports in sync. **Findings: none.** **Observations: 27.** The stored perf observation that `build_assess_spec_quality_request` reads the spec file once per rule request still holds (`payload.rs` reads it per request) and keeps its stored discard; the 10 routed and 16 discarded observations standing from this session's earlier passes still hold and keep their dispositions and keys. **060's acceptance criteria:** all nine verified — a rule is asked about in the tier its own Statement carries and at most once (`RuleSection::tier`, the step-tier filter in `handle_assessments`); every loaded rule not asked about is recorded under `rule-assessments-not-checked` or `rule-file-unreadable`, and a walk with no rule loaded records one target per assessment step; each request carries one rule whether or not its trigger fires; analyze.md steps 11 and 12 and 022's data model say the host judges the trigger and answers `passed: true`; and 066's data model counts rules, with 022's spec linking back to this spec.

## Observations

- perf: build_assess_spec_quality_request reads the spec file once per rule request, so a step reads it once for every loaded rule of its tier — `runtime/src/interpreter/payload.rs` — **discarded**: each read is a small local file the OS caches, beside an LLM round trip per request; reading it once would thread a second value through the walker context for a gain nobody has measured
- other: 039's ticked task 5 describes BE-DRAIN-002's propagation delay as counted within the grace period, which 034's review reworded — `specs/039-reliability-backend-rules/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: 036's ticked task 2 names the manifest slot it used at the time — `specs/036-quality-cross-rules/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
