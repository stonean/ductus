<!-- Rules:
     - Do not frontfill bugs that are not being actively worked on.
     - Write specs for areas being actively touched — let adoption spread naturally.
     - As specs are written, items migrate from here into spec updates or new scenarios.
     - Chores (project maintenance with no feature home — lint/formatting cleanup,
       dependency cleanup, repo hygiene) also live here; /groom recognizes them and leaves
       them in place. They clear when done, not by migrating to a spec.
     - The brownfield backlog drains toward empty as adoption completes; incidental
       capture is ongoing, so the file persists while work keeps surfacing issues.
     - Status notes do NOT belong here. Every item must be routable by /groom to one of
       its five routes (rule, spec, scenario, chore, discard); a "where things stand"
       or "what to do next" note matches none of them, so it would be walked and
       re-discarded on every pass forever. Pipeline state is derived — read it from
       /status, tasks.md, and git — not narrated into the backlog.

     Format each item as a checkbox list entry with a brief description and any relevant
     context. Three forms are in use:

     1. Manual entry (via /log) — the simple form below:
        `- [ ] {Brief description of the issue and any relevant context}`

     2. Auto-captured finding (an agent recorded this automatically while working a task,
        per §brownfield-inbox Automatic issue capture). Lead with a category so /groom can
        route it, and include a source pointer:
        `- [ ] {category}: {summary} — {file:line or area} (captured during {NNN-feature})`
        Categories: security, leak (memory/resource), convention, bug, perf, other.
        Security issues and leaks are the highest-priority captures.

     3. Audit finding written by /ductus — stricter form (see
        specs/008-security-rules/spec.md): `- [ ] {Rule ID}: {artifact} does not address — {summary}`.

     When an item is migrated, remove it from this list. -->

- Architectural exploration: re-frame the runtime's LLM extension points (`writeCode`, `writeSpecBody`, `assessSpecQuality`, future multi-turn points) as named Anthropic-style Skills the host loads at the seam, rather than ad-hoc JSON envelopes. Potential benefits: structural cache anchoring (Skills are a natural cache boundary); third-party hosts integrate against an emerging Skills protocol instead of ductus-specific JSON; `constitution-excerpts` becomes a bundled resource rather than an inline string array. Speculative — depends on Anthropic's Skills protocol stabilizing and is a larger redesign than 022's current scope. Revisit after the writeCode payload-bundling scenario on 022 ships and the cache-anchored shape proves out the pattern. Surfaced 2026-05-19 during runtime-improvement investigation. **On hold per user 2026-07-11.**
- [ ] other: the self-audit has no family asserting that a spec at `status: done` carries no unchecked acceptance criterion. 026 reached done in e9262df with AC19 unticked and every check stayed green — run-all.sh exits 0, check-artifacts reports the feature clean, CI passes. The completion gate is supposed to make this unreachable (it refuses the transition while any criterion is unchecked), so reaching it means the gate was bypassed or its marking step failed, and nothing downstream notices either way. — `scripts/audit/run-all.sh` (captured during review of 026-framework-self-audit)
- [ ] other: nothing asserts parity between `/ductus:audit`'s enumerated family list in framework/commands/audit.md and the families run-all.sh actually registers. The list had stopped at 23 while run-all.sh ran 25 families, and the three missing were the most recently added — the direction this drift always goes. Families 18 and 23 already exist as list-vs-registry parity checks, so the shape is established; this registry just never got one. — `framework/commands/audit.md` (captured during review of 026-framework-self-audit)
