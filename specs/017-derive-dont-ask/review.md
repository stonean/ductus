    reason: predates the widening for environment variables and is unchanged by it; which way an empty optional value falls is a new decision, and CFG-ENV-008 already fails a present malformed value

    outcome: discarded
    reason: a value first read later is validated when it is read, the reading 063 applies on every call, and no spec here reloads a file mid-process

    outcome: discarded
    reason: the owner's 2026-10-20 answer keeps every token out of the handshake URL, following the same cheat sheet's advice against tokens in URL query strings; (a)'s Origin allowlist is the handshake's cross-site defense, and a CSRF token can still be checked in the first message

  - key: "other: BE-API-001's Statement requires frame protection on all HTTP responses while its Verification table sets frame-ancestors on HTML responses only — `framework/rules/security-backend.md`"
    outcome: discarded
    reason: predates this window; OWASP's HTTP Headers Cheat Sheet, which BE-API-001 cites, says X-Frame-Options gives no security on a redirect or a JSON API response, while its REST Security Cheat Sheet recommends frame-ancestors 'none' on API responses, so aligning the two decides what the rule requires

    outcome: discarded
    reason: the sentence is the narrowing the owner's 2026-10-20 answer placed in both rules and matches BE-API-015's unscoped Verification; a token in a handshake URL authenticates the connection, so its endpoint is not public in practice; scoping it made the two rules disagree and was reverted

    outcome: discarded
    reason: a recovery that verifies the first code before issuing the second complies, since the first is already used; NIST SP 800-63B-4 sets no invalidation across codes and nothing in BE-AUTHN-018 forbids that order

# Review — 017-derive-dont-ask

## Summary

Re-review of 017 after tasks 39, 40 and 41, the owner's four answers of 2026-10-20 that widened `configuration-cross.md` from environment variables to configuration values from any source. 0 MUST, 0 SHOULD, 0 low-confidence, not blocking.

**Base.** `37c8219c`, the parent of the reopen (`3d7f20e9`). 008's review of `88d934d4` is the newest record over the shared window, and it read everything in this scope that changed since 022's record of `683e9204`, `configuration-cross.md`'s widening and its fixes among them. This review reads 017's own in-scope artifacts and its deliverable in full, and what changed since 008's record.

**Read** (`examined: 30`). In full: 017's `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `tasks.md` and both in-scope scenarios; `configuration-cross.md` at `5e42ec3d` by an independent pass that fetched every source the file cites (Fail Fast, Twelve-Factor, dotenv, dotenv-safe, Helm, Viper, Spring Boot and its Javadoc, Go, serde, MDN, Kubernetes, NIST, BIPM, Vite, Next.js, RFC 6749, OWASP, OpenFeature and others), and its last two edits re-read as a diff; `framework/commands/analyze.md`'s §Rules and step 5, whose two restored citation messages are the change since 008's record that is not a record or a status line. The 22 other files 008's review read this session, listed in its record, are counted here too.

**Not read.** The ten generated command mirrors (`scripts/gen-claude-commands.sh --check` in sync); `framework/bootstrap/govern.md` (`cmp` identical to `ductus.md`); 017's plan-listed templates, commands, hooks, scripts and CI files unchanged since the base (the spec templates, `amend.md`, `groom.md`, `help.md`, `implement.md`, `log.md`, `specify.md`, `target.md`, the hooks, `scripts/gen-help-tables.sh`, `scripts/install-hooks.sh`, `.github/workflows/generators.yml`, `framework/templates/ci/adopter-generators.yml`, the two `configure` files, and `specs/000-016/spec.md`); 019's runtime change set, reviewed by 019's and 022's records today; the other rule files and the constitution, read by 034's review and its siblings; and the sibling specs' other artifacts and records, 008's new `review.md` and `analysis.md` among them.

**Findings: none.** **Observations: 48.** 5 fixed: four `configuration-cross.md` wordings (`CFG-CONST-003`'s backing list, `CFG-ENV-003`'s Verification, `CFG-ENV-008`'s `parseBoolean`, `CFG-ENV-004`'s Source) and the owner's answer that a command-line flag is configuration only when it supplies a setting (task 41). 7 new discards, each with its reason. 34 discards and 2 routes carried byte-identically from 008's record. Three of 017's own stored routes expire: their routed work (AC25's annotation and two data-model corrections) has landed.

## MUST violations (blocking)

## Low-confidence findings

## Waived findings

*None.*

## Observations

- convention: CFG-CONST-003 listed only a named constant or an environment variable as an operator-tunable value's backing, so after the widening its Verification would flag a plan backing one with a configuration-file key — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **fixed**
- convention: CFG-ENV-003's Verification did not check its Statement's naming of each source checked for a value read from several sources — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **fixed**
- convention: CFG-ENV-008's Rationale said Boolean.parseBoolean reads every string other than true as false; it accepts true in any case — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **fixed**
- convention: CFG-ENV-004's Rationale made Spring Boot and Go claims its Source did not cite — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **fixed**
- other: CFG-ENV-001 and CFG-ENV-003 covered a command-line flag with nothing separating a configuration flag from a per-invocation argument; the owner's 2026-10-20 answer defined it in the file's header — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **fixed**
- other: CFG-ENV-001 does not say whether an empty value on an optional value with a default is absent or malformed — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: predates the widening for environment variables and is unchanged by it; which way an empty optional value falls is a new decision, and CFG-ENV-008 already fails a present malformed value
- other: "at startup" in CFG-ENV-003, CFG-ENV-005 and CFG-ENV-008 does not cover a configuration file a running process reads again — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: a value first read later is validated when it is read, the reading 063 applies on every call, and no spec here reloads a file mid-process
- other: CFG-ENV-008's error names the setting and the value but not the file, which CFG-ENV-003 and CFG-ENV-005 now name for a file key — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: naming the file is a new requirement on a rule today's answers did not widen; the setting and the value already locate the defect
- other: CFG-ENV-005's error names the offending value with no redaction exception like CFG-ENV-008's — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: CFG-ENV-006's MUST redaction at the config-loading layer still applies, so both rules are met together
- other: CFG-CONST-004 places a value's range bounds alongside its default constant, which a required value has none of — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: predates the widening for required environment variables; where a required value's bounds live is a new decision, and the bounds must still be named constants
- other: QUAL-GROUND-001 names CFG-ENV-003 and CFG-ENV-008 as owning configuration, not CFG-ENV-005 — `framework/rules/quality-cross.md` — **discarded**: QUAL-GROUND-001 cedes all configuration to the CFG rules, so the omission changes no finding; the two it names are the presence and type rules its scope decision cited
- other: CFG-ENV-011's Source pairs IEC 80000-13 with a NIST page that credits the binary prefixes to IEC 60027-2 — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: BIPM's VIM attributes the binary prefixes to IEC 80000-13 and NIST to its predecessor IEC 60027-2; together the two citations are accurate
- security: FE-STORAGE-003 does not repeat BE-API-013's WebSocket-handshake exclusion — `framework/rules/security-frontend.md` — **discarded**: its MAY requires a landing page that sets Referrer-Policy: no-referrer, which a WebSocket handshake has no page to do, so a handshake ticket already falls under its MUST NOT; the owner's answer placed the narrowing in BE-API-013 and BE-API-015
- security: BE-API-015's handshake-URL MUST NOT also bars a CSRF token there, which the OWASP WebSocket Security Cheat Sheet suggests sending in the handshake — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: the owner's 2026-10-20 answer keeps every token out of the handshake URL, following the same cheat sheet's advice against tokens in URL query strings; (a)'s Origin allowlist is the handshake's cross-site defense, and a CSRF token can still be checked in the first message
- other: the pre-signed-URL MAY covers object storage only, so another signed-URL scheme, a CDN's or an application's own HMAC-signed link, falls under BE-API-013 and FE-STORAGE-003 — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: the owner's 2026-10-20 answer scoped the MAY to a pre-signed URL for one object and one method; whether other signed-URL schemes fit that scope is a new decision
- other: BE-AUTHN-007's Verification asks for legitimate-recovery paths during lockout, which its Statement does not name — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: no flag condition fires on its absence; adding it to the MUST or removing it changes scope, and no accuracy defect requires either
- other: BE-API-001's Statement requires frame protection on all HTTP responses while its Verification table sets frame-ancestors on HTML responses only — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: predates this window; OWASP's HTTP Headers Cheat Sheet, which BE-API-001 cites, says X-Frame-Options gives no security on a redirect or a JSON API response, while its REST Security Cheat Sheet recommends frame-ancestors 'none' on API responses, so aligning the two decides what the rule requires
- other: BE-API-013's handshake sentence says BE-API-015 keeps every token out of the handshake URL, while BE-API-015's Statement covers only endpoints serving non-public data or accepting state-changing messages — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: the sentence is the narrowing the owner's 2026-10-20 answer placed in both rules and matches BE-API-015's unscoped Verification; a token in a handshake URL authenticates the connection, so its endpoint is not public in practice; scoping it made the two rules disagree and was reverted
- security: BE-AUTHN-018's newer-token invalidation would cancel a code issued by one method when a code by another is issued in the same recovery — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: a recovery that verifies the first code before issuing the second complies, since the first is already used; NIST SP 800-63B-4 sets no invalidation across codes and nothing in BE-AUTHN-018 forbids that order
- other: 008's ticked task rows 13, 14 and 15 describe FE-STORAGE-003, FE-DEPS-004 and BE-AUTHN-022 as they read before later edits — `specs/008-security-rules/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: CFG-ENV-005, widened to every source, does not say whether a value read from several sources is range-checked as resolved or at each source — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **discarded**: the value validated at startup is the one CFG-ENV-007's resolution yields, the reading CFG-ENV-003 states for presence, and no spec here reads a ranged value from two sources
- reliability: dropping a timed-out client joins its runtime thread, so a slow connect-time lookup can hold a fetch past FETCH_TIMEOUT — `runtime/src/primitives/fetch_archive.rs` — **discarded**: the GaiResolver it replaced behaves the same way, and in production the lookup is getaddrinfo, which the operating system resolver's own timeouts bound
- reliability: the initial and redirect-screen lookups run outside the client's timeout — `runtime/src/primitives/fetch_archive.rs` — **discarded**: unchanged by this fix and bounded the same way, by the operating system resolver's timeouts; FETCH_DEADLINE bounds the download itself
- security: a redirect hop is looked up twice rather than connected to the address its screen resolved — `runtime/src/primitives/fetch_archive.rs` — **discarded**: 022's scenario allows an equivalent connect-time re-check, both lookups are screened, and the owner prescribed this resolver and its staged-rebind test
- other: two proxy tests each define the same four-line internal-address lookup — `runtime/src/primitives/fetch_archive.rs` — **discarded**: test fixtures local to each test; sharing one would couple the tests for no gain
- other: 025's ticked task 2 lists a malformed warning among the step-5 outcomes that task 10 replaced — `specs/025-rule-opt-out/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: [rules] surfaces is validated only when a rule directory exists, while disabled entries are validated always — `runtime/src/primitives/discover_rule_files.rs` — **discarded**: with no rule directory nothing is selected, so the unread surfaces value changes no result; when it is validated is 033's degenerate-surfaces contract, not this change
- other: 063's ticked tasks 1 and 6 describe the invalid-threshold notice and default fallback that task 12 replaced — `specs/063-oversized-artifacts-warn-with-a-fix/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: 039's ticked task 5 describes BE-DRAIN-002's propagation delay as counted within the grace period, which 034's review reworded — `specs/039-reliability-backend-rules/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: 036's ticked task 2 names the manifest slot it used at the time — `specs/036-quality-cross-rules/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: configuration-cross.md's header names only analyze as enforcing it; which review pass applies the file is open — `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` — **routed** to `specs/020-code-review/scenarios/every-loaded-rule-file-has-a-pass.md`
- other: 033's task 10 names no acceptance criterion for the chosen mechanism to amend — `specs/033-rule-surface-setting/tasks.md` — **routed** to `specs/033-rule-surface-setting/tasks.md`
- other: FE-SEMHTML-001 and FE-ARIA-001 both forbid a div with role=button — `framework/rules/accessibility-frontend.md` — **discarded**: consistent overlap of two MUSTs with no contradiction; consolidating them changes rule ownership, which 069's clarify owns
- other: FE-KBD-002 and FE-CONTRAST-001 both require 3:1 for focus indicators — `framework/rules/accessibility-frontend.md` — **discarded**: the owner decided FE-KBD-002's MUST carries the 3:1 ratio (069 Resolved Questions, 2026-10-19); the overlap is consistent
- other: accessibility-frontend.md's first header paragraph is long — `framework/rules/accessibility-frontend.md` — **discarded**: style only; the content is accurate, and 069's first open question owns what the header claims about conformance
- other: FE-STORAGE-006 confines its Cache API MUST to service-worker code — `framework/rules/security-frontend.md` — **discarded**: the rule is accurate as scoped; widening a MUST to page scripts is a new requirement for the owner, not an accuracy defect
- other: BE-REPR-001's Verification names specs/system.md for the API-wide representation — `framework/rules/api-backend.md` — **discarded**: the Statement's one representation across the API needs a declared one to be checkable; the Verification names where it is declared
- other: BE-SCHEMA-001's SDL-versus-introspection split and BE-ERRENV-001's overlap with BE-ERR-002 — `framework/rules/api-backend.md` — **discarded**: both splits are recorded as intended in 068; low
- other: BE-AUTHN-010's factor list reads as closed — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: the sentence carries no obligation keyword and the Verification enforces MFA presence, the SMS-sole ban and no skip path, consistent with BE-AUTHN-021; whether push is acceptable is a substantive owner change
- other: BE-DEPS-002 and BE-DEPS-006 Verifications ask for an update process their Statements do not name — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: no flag condition fires on its absence; adding it to the MUST or removing it changes scope, and no accuracy defect requires either
- other: security-backend.md's header lists its categories in a different order from its sections — `framework/rules/security-backend.md` — **discarded**: the category set matches; no artifact specifies the order, and the header matches 008's data-model table order
- other: BE-COORD-001's Verification asks a plan to say whether a lock guards correctness or efficiency — `framework/rules/concurrency-backend.md` — **discarded**: the Statement's MAY turns on that classification; the Verification asks for exactly the fact it needs
- other: BE-QUERY-004, BE-POOL-005 and BE-TXN-004 repeat PostgreSQL background sentences — `framework/rules/performance-backend.md` — **discarded**: the repeated sentences are accurate and not contradictory; each rule stands alone
- other: concurrency, observability, reliability, quality and configuration section titles are sentence case — `framework/rules/concurrency-backend.md` — **discarded**: 017's and 036's data models record their files' category names in sentence case (017 task 38, an owner decision); 008's title-case bullet describes the security files
- other: ticked task-1 items in 037, 038 and 039 say one RFC 2119 keyword, and 039's task 4 names an alert — `specs/039-reliability-backend-rules/tasks.md` — **discarded**: spent task history: each records what the task said when it was done, and rewriting it records a fiction
- other: 008's first resolved question reasons from CI gating — `specs/008-security-rules/spec.md` — **discarded**: a resolved question records the reasoning at the time; rewriting it records a fiction
- perf: readers parse the same config text twice, once as a table for the key names and once as their typed struct — `runtime/src/schema/config_keys.rs` — **discarded**: the files are a few hundred bytes, and parsing the typed struct from the text keeps a wrong-typed value's error located by its line, which a conversion from the parsed table loses
- other: a misspelled section name such as [artifact] is never examined, so its settings take their defaults without a word — `runtime/src/schema/config_keys.rs` — **discarded**: the owner's 2026-10-20 decision scopes the check to owned sections; flagging near-miss section names would be a new requirement
